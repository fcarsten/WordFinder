# WordFinder

Classic word finding game for Android: You get a 5x5 grid of random letters and have to find as many words as possible using strings of
adjacent letters. Each letter can field can only be used once per word. You can compare your results to what the program can find,
but you can't beat it - it does an exhaustive search of the dictionary.
